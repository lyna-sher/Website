Language of instruction The class, syllabus and the reference book are in Dutch.\nLearning outcomes The aim of this course is to provide the students with a first approach to a rigorous analysis of the micro-economic mechanisms of a market economy. More specifically, the objectives are:\n  Familiarize the students with the basic concepts and the fundamental mechanisms of the micro-economic analysis;\n  Get the students to use those mechanisms and concepts to carry out a rigorous analysis of several \u0026ldquo;real-life\u0026rdquo; economic problems and economic policy recommendations;\n  Introduce students to information literacy in order to help students to deal efficiently with information and carry out effective research. Train the students to read critically and synthetize the contents of economic articles/texts.\n  The chosen methodology is a qualitative and graphical presentation of economic models, so as to draw the students' attention to the explanative power as well as the limits of the modelling approach.\nCourse content The Economics 1 course consists of 3 parts. In part 1, we will start with a presentation of the economic problem as a coordination problem, and explore for a first time the functioning of markets and public interventions in markets. Part 2 focusses on the supply side of the market. We explore the theory of the firm, the production and cost functions, and the behavior of producers in the context of market in perfect competition, monopoly and imperfect competition. In part 2, we focus on an evalution of the functioning of markets from the point of view of social welfare. We study several market failures and and analyze a series of potential solutions to such market failures.\nCourse materials  Reference book: André Decoster and Erwin Ooghe (eds). Economie.

Available at the service de reprographie  Learning activities a) Plenary lectures During the plenary lectures, the professor presents the concepts and mechanisms associated to the different models. Those lectures will follow the course outline presented above. From a methodological point of view, numerous press articles will be used as bibliographical support beyond the reference book. The objective is twofold: train the students to a careful reading and synthesis of economic texts, as well as draw the students' attention to the omnipresence of economic questions in the public debate.\nb) Exercise sessions (TA sessions) The exercise sessions are carried out in small groups, and aim at checking knowledge acquisition as well as applying the theoretical concepts presented in class to solve exercises and case studies. So as to benefit from those sessions, the students should have reviewed the corresponding lectures. Those exercise sessions will also be partly devoted to critical reading of economic articles.\nc) Personal work Regular personal work is critical for success. As the course goes on, each student is expected to devote sufficient time so as to make sure he/she understands the subjects being treated. The revision period at the end of the semester should not be the occasion to discover the course contents, but rather to strengthen the comprehension of a course that is already known by the student. Personal meetings with the course assistants and the professor can be arranged for the students who specifically ask it.\nd) Paper assignment Each student will hand in a short paper in which concepts of the course are applied to a press article, chosen by the student from a list of press articles made available on the course website.\nMeet your instructor Lyna Sheremeta ","date":1611446400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1611446400,"objectID":"da2143272837e079e3aa62b511ef4bce","permalink":"https://vasylyna-sheremeta.netlify.app/courses/economie1/","publishdate":"2021-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/economie1/","section":"courses","summary":"An introduction to (micro-)economics for BAC 1 students (economics, business, business engineering), and for BAC 2 students in political and social sciences.","tags":null,"title":"ESPO1173 - Economie 1 (NL)","type":"book"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Table of Contents  Mode of delivery Language of instruction Learning outcomes Course content Course materials Learning activities Meet your instructor    Mode of delivery  Face-to-face, First term, 45 hours of theory 4 hours of exercise sessions plus sessions with TA in function of a group work  Language of instruction The lectures, syllabus and textbook are provided in English.\nLearning outcomes This course studies the role of the state in a market economy. At the end of the course, the student will be able to analyze the different costs and benefits of different public policies and interventions, both in terms of efficiency and in terms of equity. The theoretical lectures provide a formal introduction to classical public economic theory, and discuss in detail the Belgian institutional context. The course aims primarily to develop a solid intuitive understanding of the theory, and considers various case-studies of current important societal questions and an analysis of current public debates. The students will learn how to put the theoretical concepts into practice in the exercise sessions, and acquire the tools to work in group with real world datasets in order to analyze and assess public policies.\nCourse content The first part of the course will be devoted to the normative analysis of the role of the state in the economy. We first introduce the economic problem and the various coordination mechanisms. We proceed with market efficiency and its limits, public goods, externalities, the analysis of economic inequalities and the redistribution of incomes, collective decision-making processes, and ultimately cost-benefit analysis. The second part of the course studies the Belgian fiscal framework, and situates the Belgian reality in a historic and international context. We study the Belgian public expenditures by means of the budget and national accounts, and introduce different theories to explain the growth of the public sector. Next, the course focusses on analyzing government revenue. We will study the Belgian tax system, with special attention for the personal income tax, and analyze the role of public debt. We consider the economics of taxation and provide a brief introduction to the theory of optimal taxation. The third part will develop the theory of fiscal federalism and analyze the federal structure of Belgium.\n Introduction: the economic problem and public finances (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapters 1 \u0026amp; 2) Market efficiency: theorems of welfare economics and market failures (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 3) Public goods (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 4) Externalities, with an application to transport economics (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 5) Analysis of economic inequality and income redistribution (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 12) Political economy (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 6) Cost-benefit analysis (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 8) Public expenditure (in part: Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 6) Taxation and tax policy in Belgium The public debt (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 20) The Economics of Taxation: Efficiency and Incidence (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapters 14-15) The principles of optimal taxation (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 16) Fiscal federalism and the Belgian federal system (Rosen \u0026amp; Gayer, Chapter 22)  Course materials  Harvey S.

We investigate optimal indirect taxation when both the intrinsic qualities of goods and signaling motivate consumption choices. Optimal indirect taxes are introduced into a monotonic signaling game. We provide sufficient conditions for the uniqueness of the D1 sequential equilibrium strate- gies. In the case of pure costly signaling, signaling goods can in equilibrium be taxed without burden. When commodities serve both intrinsic consumption and signaling, optimal taxes are characterized by a Ramsey rule, which deals with distortions resulting from signaling.","tags":["Public Finance"],"title":"Signaling and Indirect Taxation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lyna Sheremeta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1317427200,"objectID":"1c2ccbe79193338f53f9188fec2a92b2","permalink":"https://vasylyna-sheremeta.netlify.app/publication/truyts2011/","publishdate":"2011-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/truyts2011/","section":"publication","summary":"In the past decades, the economic analysis of social networks and groups has rapidly developed. This article discusses a few mechanisms through which social networks and groups affect poverty and social and economic inequality. Social net- works and groups can both keep people in poverty or be tools for the emancipation of the poor. An efficient poverty reducing policy should account for these mechanisms or even employ them for the greater good.","tags":["Networks"],"title":"Networks, Group Identity and Poverty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lyna Sheremeta","Maarten Van Dijck"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1298937600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1298937600,"objectID":"e39158847139090aa6612246e5d95948","permalink":"https://vasylyna-sheremeta.netlify.app/publication/vandijck2011/","publishdate":"2011-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/vandijck2011/","section":"publication","summary":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

This paper provides a selective survey of recent advances in the economic analysis of the origins and consequences of social status concerns. First, a selection of empirical research from a variety of scientific disciplines is discussed to underpin the further theoretical analysis. I then consider the origins and determinants of tastes for status, discuss the endogenous derivation of such preferences for relative standing and assess the different formalizations of these preferences. Subsequently, the consequences of preferences for status are studied for a variety of problems and settings. The last section discusses a number of implications of status concerns for normative economics and public policy.","tags":["Social Status"],"title":"Social Status in Economic Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://vasylyna-sheremeta.netlify.app/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
