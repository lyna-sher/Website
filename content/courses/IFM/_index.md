## Learning outcomes

Students will obtain knowledge about the financial markets and will learn how to define and identify fundamental financial concepts, among which e.g. financial products. After having learned the basic terminology of the financial world, they will be able to understand financial economic newspaper articles (and reports) and explain them in their own words. They will also learn how to apply the theoretical concepts during exercise sessions during which financial problems will be solved (e.g. with respect to time value of money, the term structure of interest rates, pricing of financial instruments and the risk-return trade off) and graphical representations will have to be made.



## Course content
In a first part, money and the financial system will be introduced. In order to enable the pricing of financial instruments, the time value of money will be addressed. Present and future value calculations of a single cash flow, of cash flow streams, annuities and perpetuities will be taught.
Both money market (treasury bills, commercial paper, repo) and capital market products (bonds, stocks) will be discussed. We will go into the pricing and the risk of bonds and stocks.
Finally the importance of financial intermediaries is addressed, focusing on the structure of the financial industry, the depository institutions and the regulator.
